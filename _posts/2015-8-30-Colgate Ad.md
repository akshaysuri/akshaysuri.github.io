title: Ingenious Colgate Ad
---

Colgate has created a very ingenious advertising campaign to promote their dental floss, but before I explain the main details of these images, I will let  you appreciate them quietly.

Alright, now that you had time to quietly observe the images, some of you might wonder what's so special about this ad.

<b>
In the first image you will notice that the lady has one extra finger, <br>
In the second image a phantom arm is floating around, <br>
In the third image the man has only one ear. <br>
</b>
The campaign attained its purpose, because it proved that food that remains on your teeth draws more attention than any physical defect...
