title: The subtle color trick Advertisement industry plays
---



You might have missed this subtle trick that the advertisement industry has been pulling off.

Your brain is presented with a visually dominating screen which is of the same color as the product.
The color of the product is emphasised on the screen to establish a sense of familiarity with that product.

I would take a few examples and let the images speak for themselves in this post:

<b> RED </b> <br>
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_images/color_Pys_col.jpg)

<b> YELLOW </b> <br>
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_images/color_Pys_mag.jpg)

<b> GREEN </b> <br>
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_images/color_Pys_spr.jpg)

<b> BLUE </b> <br>
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_images/color_Pys_ujala.jpg)

<b> RED(colgate) + GREEN(neem variant) </b> <br>
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_images/color_Pys_neem.jpg)
